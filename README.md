# covidHelp
Trying to build a Covid19 social working network to help users connect to each other with 3 basic types of resources
1. Raw material (food clothing)
2. transportation 
3. volunteer (hands on insitu help for people)

they should ideally be able to:
1. ping each other if they know people in need 
2. ping to connect the 3 types of resources so it can be fulfilled
3. locality (area wise) connection
